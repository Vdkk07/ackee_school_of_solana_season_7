# Ackee School of Solana ‚Äî Season 7 (Portfolio) üöÄ

This repository documents my learning journey in Ackee School of Solana Season 7 ‚Äî  
a rigorous, hands-on program focused on building secure, efficient, and production-ready Solana programs with Rust and the Anchor framework.


Throughout this cohort, I built weekly projects and demos that reflect foundational and advanced concepts of Solana smart contract development‚Äîfrom the basics of blockchain and Rust, all the way to custom token programs, frontend integration, and real-world security practices.

## üìÅ Project Index  
**Week 1: Introduction to Solana & Blockchain**  
- Explored Solana‚Äôs core innovations: Proof of History, Sealevel, and high-performance transaction processing. 
- Set up a complete local development environment using Solana CLI and Anchor. 

**Week 2: Rust & Anchor Fundamentals**  
- Learned Rust fundamentals: ownership, lifetimes, and type safety. 
- Built introductory smart contracts using Anchor, and understood how it simplifies Solana development.

**Week 3: Solana Programming Model I**  
- Learned account structure, data storage, and Program Derived Addresses (PDAs).
- Built on-chain programs using Anchor's account validation system.
- Implemented custom error handling and simple stateful logic.

**Week 4: Solana Programming Model II + CPI**  
- Explored Cross-Program Invocations (CPI) and inter-program communication.
- Interacted with the SPL Token program via CPI for token transfers.
- Built a modular smart contract using nested accounts and secure data handling.

**Week 5: Best Development Practices & Debugging**  
- Learned professional development practices for writing clean and maintainable code.  
- Explored debugging strategies and tips to quickly identify and resolve issues in Solana programs.  

**Week 6: Front-end for Solana Programs**  
- Connected on-chain programs to a frontend using the official Solana Scaffold.  
- Built a simple **Ticket Registry app** to register, list, and manage tickets through the web interface.  

**Week 7: Solana Security**  
- Studied common vulnerabilities in Solana programs and how attackers exploit them.  
- Learned best practices for securing smart contracts and preventing exploits.  

**Bonus Lesson 1: Token 2022**  
- Explored how tokens work on Solana with Token-2022 extensions.  
- Built a step-by-step example leveraging advanced token features.  

**Bonus Lesson 2: Introduction to Pinocchio**  
- Discovered Pinocchio, a zero-dependency Rust library for writing Solana programs.  
- Learned how byte-level input handling and zero-copy types improve compute efficiency.  

**Bonus Lesson 3: Gaming on Solana**  
- Gained insights into Solana game development and the wider gaming ecosystem.  

**Bonus Lesson 4: Technical Writing Best Practices**  
- Learned how to write effective documentation.  
- Understood why good writing is essential for clear communication in open-source and blockchain development.
